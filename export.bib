   abstract = {An adequate theory of happiness or subjective well-being (SWB) needs to link at least three sets of variables: stable person characteristics (including personality traits), life events and measures of well-being (life satisfaction, positive affects) and ill-being (anxiety, depression, negative affects). It also needs to be based on long-term data in order to account for long-term change in SWB. By including personality measures in the 2005 survey, the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) became the first available dataset to provide long-term evidence about personality and change in one key measure of SWB, namely life satisfaction. Using these data, the paper suggests major revisions to the set-point theory of SWB; revisions which seek to account for long-term change. Previously, theory focused on evidence that individuals have their own set-point of SWB and revert to that set-point once the psychological impact of major life events has dissipated. But the new SOEP panel data show that significant minorities record substantial and apparently permanent upward or downward changes in life satisfaction. The paper aims to explain why most people's SWB levels do not change, but why a minority do. The main new result, which must be regarded as tentative until replicated, is that the people most likely to record large changes in life satisfaction are those who score high on the personality traits of extraversion (E) and/or neuroticism (N). These people in a sense 'roll the dice' more often than others and so have a higher than average probability of recording long-term changes. Data come from the 3130 SOEP respondents who rated their life satisfaction every year from 1985 onwards, among whom 2843 also completed a set of questions about their personality in 2005. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.},

We find significant increases in the frequency and intensity of alcohol consumption combined with a significant decrease in moderate physical activities as a response to partner's retirement. In line with the existing literature, we find that own retirement has significant positive effects on engaging in moderate and vigorous physical activities but also leads to a significant increase in the frequency of alcohol intake.

For the identification, we exploit a sizable cohort-specific pension reform which abolished an early retirement program for all women born after 1951. Our results show that health care costs significantly increase by about 2.9% in the age group directly affected by the increase in the retirement age (women aged 60–62). We further show that the cost increase is mainly driven by the following specialist groups: Ophthalmologists, general practitioners (GPs), neurology, orthopedics, and radiology. While the effects are significant and meaningful on the individual level, we show that the increase in health care costs is modest relative to the positive fiscal effects of the pension reform. Specifically, we estimate an aggregate increase in the health costs of about 7.7 million euro for women born in 1952 aged 60–62 which amounts to less than 2% of the overall positive fiscal effects of the pension reform.},

   abstract = {The effect of retirement on life satisfaction is a research topic that received a lot of attention, yet provided heterogeneous results. The current study suggests a remedy for this situation by taking two predictors of diversity (i.e. education and last labor market status) into account. We assumed that changes in social status and changes in resources influence retirement adjustment. The social status change affects retirees in the short-term, whereas individuals’ resources indicated by education predict long-term adjustment. To disentangle these processes, we contrasted exits from full-time employment and transitions from unemployment. We used data from the German Socio-Economic Panel to estimate a multi-group, multi-episodes dual change score model. The development of life satisfaction is lastingly interrupted by retirement. A short-term increase in life satisfaction was found for both transition groups but was more pronounced for those being previously unemployed. Life satisfaction develops in the long-term education-specific: retirees who have more education show almost constant life satisfaction whereas those retirees who have less education experience a decline. The results indicate that retirement entails a major change in the way people live. Adjustment to this can be characterized by two processes: A status change enfolds in the short-term. A building of new daily routines using individuals’ resources develops in the long-term. Both processes can be interpreted in terms of cumulative inequality: last labor market status differences decrease in the short-term but remain. Educational differences increase after retirement.},

   abstract = {Purpose: This study examines how life satisfaction changes as a function of the transition into retirement, distinguishing between different types of voluntary and involuntary exits. Design and Methods: Perceived satisfaction with life (SWL) was measured among 1,388 older Dutch workers on two occasions, separated by 6 years. During that time, more than half of participants (54%) left full-time employment and entered retirement. Results: Those who made a voluntarily departure from the workforce reported higher levels of perceived SWL compared with those who remained employed, whereas the life satisfaction scores of those whose departure was involuntary (due to health reasons, organizational reasons) were found to be the lowest. Other factors that had an effect on satisfaction included positive and negative health changes experienced during the 6-year interim, as well as changes in marital status due to divorce or loss of a spouse. Implications: These findings have important theoretical implications for the understanding of factors that shape individuals' perceptions of how they view the quality of their lives. From an applied perspective, the findings have implications for the development of organizational initiatives aimed at helping workers transition into retirement in such a way as to maintain high levels of subjective well-being. © 2013 The Author.},

   abstract = {Research over the past 30 years concerning the effect of retirement on personal adjustment has resulted in conflicting findings. Some studies reported a negative effect for retirement; others showed no effect at all. This study utilized the National Longitudinal Surveys of Mature Men to test the net effect of retirement on happiness with life and to analyze an evaluation of retirement item in order to discern specific factors that cause lower satisfaction with retirement. Logistic multiple regression and ordinary least squares regression were used in the analysis. The main findings are as follows: (a) although a negative bivariate relationship exists between retirement and happiness with life, retirement has no significant net effect; (b) health factors, recent widowhood, and income have the greatest impact on happiness with life; and (c) poor health, lower income, and earlier-than-expected retirement are the main determinants of negative evaluations of retirement. A PRIMARY question in early gerontologi-cal research was how the loss of the work role, that is, retirement, affected the social and psychological adjustment of older people. Fried-mann and Orbach (1974) noted how early research in this area was based on an ideological bias that viewed retirement as a crisis situation. Cavan et al. (1949) clearly perceived retirement as problematic for most workers, not just because of the economic loss but also because of the loss of status and of a meaningful role. In setting out the basic role theory approach for the longitudinal Cornell Study of Occupational Retirement, Barron et al. (1952) viewed the loss of the work role as often leading to physical and mental breakdowns, as well as less serious psychological difficulties. Research over the past 30 years has resulted in inconsistent findings regarding the relationship between the loss of the work role and the psychological well-being of older people. The primary purpose of this research was to investigate the relationship between retirement of men, some correlates of retirement, and an aspect of psychological well-being not often examined among older people, happiness with life. Also, an attempt was made to specify those men more likely to be negatively affected by retirement by analyzing the determinants of an evaluation of retirement item. In this paper, some of the previous research on the effects of retirement on personal satisfaction or happiness and reti-rees' satisfaction with retirement is reviewed, and data from the National Longitudinal Surveys of Mature Men are then analyzed to test a variety of hypotheses. PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON ADJUSTMENT TO RETIREMENT Most of the early research on the effect of retirement on adjustment supported the hypothesis that loss of the work role results in lowered satisfaction. In studies conducted during the 1950s it was found that retirees had lower morale (Kutner et al., 1956) and a greater degree of maladjustment than workers (Phillips, 1957). The results of one of the best studies of retirement to date, the longitudinal Cornell Study of Occupational Retirement, contradict the findings of these earlier studies (Thompson et al., 1960). The authors found that retirement resulted in a somewhat higher degree of dissatisfaction with life but not a greater degree of dejection or hopelessness. More importantly, further analysis revealed that it was not the loss of the work role itself, but lower income (or feelings of financial deprivation), poor health, and negative attitude toward retirement that were responsible for the greater proportion of dissatisfied respondents among the retired 616 at},

Analyses of the constituents of life satisfaction showed greater optimism and future orientation among recent retirees and a comparative deficit at 13 to 18 months.

   abstract = {Retirement has traditionally been seen as the beginning of old age. It has been depicted as mandatory expulsion front the workforce and seen to mark the transition to a period of ill health and poverty. Such ideas and associations are however being challenged in the developed world by socio-demographic changes in retirement and old age. People in the United Kingdom as elsewhere are living longer and healthier lives, and many older people have access to non-state incomes that afford them a reasonable standard of living in retirement. There is however still concern that inequalities persist into old age. Data from two waves of the British Whitehall II study have been used to assess the relative effects of occupational grade, psychological and general health during working life, and retirement patterns or pathways on activities, attitudes to health and income in retirement. The results show that the majority of the sample reported good health, financial security and overall satisfaction with life, but with observable inequalities. Regression analyses demonstrate that pre-retirement circumstances generally had a greater effect on later life than the retirement route or pathway. Retirement no longer represents a drastic break between working and post-work life but rather, the results suggest, there are continuities between the two periods. It is concluded that the main causes of inequalities in retirement are work-based rather than in retirement itself. © 2004 Cambridge University Press.},

The present meta-analysis examines (a) whether life events have different effects on affective and cognitive well-being and (b) how the rate of adaptation varies across different life events. Longitudinal data from 188 publications (313 samples, N = 65,911) were integrated to describe the reaction and adaptation to 4 family events (marriage, divorce, bereavement, childbirth) and 4 work events (unemployment, reemployment, retirement, relocation/migration). The findings show that life events have very different effects on affective and cognitive well-being and that for most events the effects of life events on cognitive well-being are stronger and more consistent across samples. Different life events differ in their effects on SWB, but these effects are not a function of the alleged desirability of events. The results are discussed with respect to their theoretical implications, and recommendations for future studies on adaptation are given. © 2011 American Psychological Association.},

   abstract = {The study analyses whether and to what degree specific routes into retirement affect older people, i. e. the relationship between heterogeneous exit patterns and post-retirement health and wellbeing. We used longitudinal data from two points in time; data related to t0 were collected in 1993, 1994, 1995 and 1996 and data related to t1 were collected in 2002 and 2003 (N = 589). We focused on older people (55+ at t1) who were employed at t0 and retired at t1. We used confirmative factor analysis to identify identical measures of health and wellbeing at both t0 and t1. Hence, we were able to control for pre-retirement health and wellbeing when evaluating the effects of different exit routes. These routes were defined as dependence on incomes from sickness benefit, disability pension, part-time pension, unemployment insurance and active labour market programmes. Our initial structural equation model showed a clear relation between exit routes and post-retirement wellbeing. People who prior to retirement were pushed into social benefit programmes related to health and unemployment were significantly worse off as retirees, especially those with health-related benefits. However, these relationships disappeared once pre-retirement wellbeing was added to the model. Our main conclusion is that post-retirement wellbeing first and foremost is a consequence of accumulation of advantages and disadvantages during the life course. Both labour market exit routes and post-retirement wellbeing can be seen as outcomes of this process. There are no independent effects of the retirement process. Judging from our findings, there is no reason to believe that involvement in social security programmes allowing early retirement on health grounds has any additional negative consequences for health and wellbeing. © 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Retirement is an important life course transition, potentially involving major changes to an individual's economic and social circumstances. This research contributes to a better understanding of the retirement experience in Australian society by identifying variations in life satisfaction following retirement and the individual characteristics associated with these variations. Latent growth mixture models were used to analyze data from the first 11 waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey and included 724 people who made a single transition into retirement. Some retirees maintained high life satisfaction across the retirement transition (40%), others experienced declining levels of life satisfaction from a high level prior to retirement (28%), some experienced increasing life satisfaction from a low level prior to retirement (14%), while another group reported a declining low level of life satisfaction (18%). These results indicate considerable diversity in life satisfaction that is masked by analyses that focus on overall averages. Individuals who experience significant declines in life satisfaction tend to have worse health and lower access to a range of social and economic resources compared to other groups. We conclude that retirement is not a uniform experience and that changes in life satisfaction over the retirement transition are associated with both pre- and postretirement experiences.},

Dominant models of subjective well-being (SWB) suggest that people can adapt to almost any life event and that happiness levels fluctuate around a biologically determined set point that rarely changes.

Although inborn factors certainly matter and some adaptation does occur, events such as divorce, death of a spouse, unemployment, and disability are associated with lasting changes in SWB. These recent studies also show that there are considerable individual differences in the extent to which people adapt. Thus, happiness levels do change, and adaptation is not inevitable.},

   abstract = {An adequate theory of happiness or subjective well-being (SWB) needs to link at least three sets of variables: stable person characteristics (including personality traits), life events and measures of well-being (life satisfaction, positive affects) and ill-being (anxiety, depression, negative affects). It also needs to be based on long-term data in order to account for long-term change in SWB. By including personality measures in the 2005 survey, the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) became the first available dataset to provide long-term evidence about personality and change in one key measure of SWB, namely life satisfaction. Using these data, the paper suggests major revisions to the set-point theory of SWB; revisions which seek to account for long-term change. Previously, theory focused on evidence that individuals have their own set-point of SWB and revert to that set-point once the psychological impact of major life events has dissipated. But the new SOEP panel data show that significant minorities record substantial and apparently permanent upward or downward changes in life satisfaction. The paper aims to explain why most people's SWB levels do not change, but why a minority do. The main new result, which must be regarded as tentative until replicated, is that the people most likely to record large changes in life satisfaction are those who score high on the personality traits of extraversion (E) and/or neuroticism (N). These people in a sense 'roll the dice' more often than others and so have a higher than average probability of recording long-term changes. Data come from the 3130 SOEP respondents who rated their life satisfaction every year from 1985 onwards, among whom 2843 also completed a set of questions about their personality in 2005. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.},

   abstract = {Background and Objectives: Recent research on life satisfaction in retirement explores gender differences but yields inconsistent patterns and does not consider gendered sources of satisfaction. We use a gender relations framework to examine whether women and men experience different changes in life satisfaction with retirement, and whether observed differences are a consequence of different assessments of the leisure, family, and financial situations that characterize their post-retirement lives. Research Design and Methods: We use longitudinal data drawn from men and women in the Health and Retirement Study who transitioned into retirement between ages 62 and 72 for the first time between 2008 and 2016 (N = 593). We employ ordinary least squares regression and mediation tests to assess gender differences in overall and domain-specific life satisfaction (i.e., leisure, family, finances). Results: Men reported increased life satisfaction following retirement, but women did not. No gender differences related to leisure or family life post-retirement emerged. Gender was associated with post-retirement satisfaction with finances (p <. 001), with men reporting higher financial satisfaction. Mediation models confirmed a gender disparity in overall life satisfaction mediated by satisfaction with finances post-retirement (p <. 01), explaining approximately one-third of the disparity. Discussion and Implications: This study shows men derive greater improvements in life satisfaction in association with retirement than do women, and some of this disparity relates to women's lower satisfaction with their finances. These findings should caution policy-makers from assuming how women's increased labor force participation influences financial security in retirement, and encourage scholars to consider how gender influences subjective assessments of later life.},

   abstract = {This study seeks to extend the research on retirement in two ways. First, using a nationally representative sample, I attempt to clarify the relationship between gender and life satisfaction in retirement by explicitly considering how gender structures preretirement employment experiences. Second, I ask whether the "male model" of life satisfaction in retirement can be used to assess women's life satisfaction in retirement. It is hypothesized that employment structures, through their influence on sources of work satisfaction and world view, influence the sources of life satisfaction in retirement. While this hypothesis is generally supported, gender still appears to define a context for the variables of the male model beyond that encompassed by employment structures. The sources and implications of this gender influence for future social gerontological research, particularly in the area of retirement, are discussed. A CRUCIAL issue in the social sciences concerns the •**• extent to which theoretical insights derived from men's experiences can be generalized to women's. Attending to women's experiences has not only opened new areas of inquiry; it has also enhanced understanding of more traditional research areas (Stacey and Thorne, 1985). The sociology of work and organizations, for example, has benefited tremendously from the groundbreaking work of Kanter (1977) and Feldberg and Glenn (1979). These scholars not only revealed the tacit gender bias in models used to examine the experiences of men and women workers; they also demonstrated that incorporating the lived reality of women broadens our knowledge of both genders (Hess, 1990). Social gerontology has only begun to incorporate wom-en's experiences into theory construction. For example, whereas labor force participation and life expectancy vary by gender, we have yet to examine how generalizing from men's experiences to women's may yield a systematic theoretical bias in questions guiding retirement research. To be sure, the increased retirement rate among women (Clark, 1988; Minkler and Stone, 1985; Szinovacz, 1982) has led to a recent surge of studies comparing women's and men's adjustment processes (e.g., Martin Matthews and Brown, 1987; Palmore et al., 1985; Seccombe and Lee, 1986). But the questions tend to be of the following variety: Do women adjust more or less easily than men? Are men's concerns about retirement equally crucial to those of women? While these and similar questions have been the focus of several studies that reached disparate and contradictory conclusions (Gratton and Haug, 1983), no investigations have addressed possible gender bias in the theoretical models informing retirement research. The present research attempts to clarify the relationship between gender and life satisfaction during retirement in two ways. First, I ask if the conventional model of life satisfaction in retirement, derived from the experiences of men, is appropriate for understanding women's experiences. Using a nationally representative sample of women and men to compare factors important to retirees' life satisfaction, I apply the "male model" to both genders-not merely to see if women "fit" but to assess the model itself. Second, I focus on gender relations, socially constructed power relations between women and men, which become institutional-ized in various social arenas. For present purposes, the importance of gender relations concerns those stemming from differential employment experiences that might structure life satisfaction in retirement. My intent, then, is to offer a partial alternative to the male model of life satisfaction in retirement.},

This paper partly revises the dynamic equilibrium (DE) theory of subjective well being (SWB), sometimes termed set point theory. Results from four national panel surveys show that correlations among measures of SWB diminish over time, and that the SWB set points of a minority of individuals substantially change. These results mean that DE theory requires revision to make it more dynamic and enable it to better account for medium term change in SWB. The paper identifies personality traits and life events associated with subsequent changes in SWB. Data come from German, British and Australian panel surveys in which SWB has been measured for between 9 and 20 years. Panel regression random and fixed effects models were used to analyse the data.},

We control for changes in financial and health situations of the individual and the situations of the partner. When retiring, people do not immediately report (on average) a different level of life satisfaction, but after 2 years, life satisfaction decreases compared to the beginning of the retirement [identified as Atchley’s honeymoon effect (The sociology or retirement, Wiley, New York, 1976)]. If well-being is expressed as agency-freedom, well-being is immediately positively affected, and this effect does not change after 2 years of retirement. This paper also investigates several forms of heterogeneities in the transition from work to retirement. We consider partial, early and joint retirement, part-time employment and self-employment, and job quality. We find that there is no difference in overall well-being between being partially and fully retired, between being retired before or after the normal retirement age or between those who retire simultaneously with their partner and those who do not. However, for some older workers, such as those employed with a low-quality job, retirement can be a relief from their current employment status. In summary, a policy for longer working careers is, on average, not detrimental to well-being, but some specific groups need special treatment.},

   abstract = {Germany still has a very generous public pay-as-you-go pension system. It is characterized by early effective retirement ages and very high effective replacement rates. Most workers receive virtually all of their retirement income from this public retirement insurance. Costs are almost 12 percent of GDP, more than 2.5 times as much as the U.S. Social Security System. The pressures exerted by population aging on this monolithic system, amplified by negative incentive effects, have induced a reform process that began in 1992 and is still ongoing. This process is the topic of this paper. It has two parts. Part A describes the German pension system as it has shaped the labor market until about the year 2000. Part B describes the three staged reform process that will convert the exemplary and monolithic Bismarckian public insurance system after the year 2000 into a complex multipillar system. The paper delivers an assessment in how far these reform steps will solve the pressing problems of a prototypical pay-as-you-go system of old age provision, hopefully with lessons for other countries with similar problems.},

The analysis is based on official records covering all individuals insured by the public health system in Germany and including all certified diagnoses by practitioners. This enables us to gain a detailed understanding of the multi-dimensionality in these health effects. The empirical findings reflect the multi-dimensionality but allow for deriving two broader conclusions. We provide evidence that the increase in the retirement age negatively affects health outcomes as the prevalence of several diagnoses, e.g., mental health, musculoskeletal diseases, and obesity, increases. In contrast, we do not find support for an improvement in health related to a prolonged working life. These findings are robust to sensitivity checks, and do not change when correcting for multiple hypothesis testing.},

   abstract = {Abstract: The idea that measures of happiness, or subjective well-being, should be used as the sole (or dominant) measure of country progress has gained considerable support. This paper traces the origins of the approach in the works of eighteenth-century and nineteenth-century utilitarians, whose thinking ultimately provided the foundations for income as the measure of progress, equating income and utility. In contrast, the recent approach of neo-utilitarians intends to replace income as the objective by measures of happiness derived from surveys. This paper assesses happiness as the objective of development and a measure of progress, contrasting it with human rights and capabilities approaches and the promotion of justice, which each also challenge the income measure. The paper considers problems with the happiness approach arising from difficulties in measurement, people's tendency to adapt to their circumstances, and its inability to capture the well-being of future generations, while also providing a weak basis for distributional judgements. The author argues that human progress involves promoting human fulfilment or flourishing (including meeting agency goals), securing a just distribution, and ensuring that this is sustained over generations. Cross-country surveys of human well-being can go nowhere near to measuring this extensive array of objectives.},

Using the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, we estimate a two-layer model based on the interrelation between the different domains of job satisfaction and wherein the individual’s overall job satisfaction depends on each of these domains. The results show that the levels of satisfaction with the recognition of the work, support in difficult situations and physical effort have a significant effect on the overall job satisfaction reported by limited disabled workers. For this group, the trade-offs between the domains recognition with work and support and satisfaction with salary are especially high. These findings can help organizations, managers and policy makers to design or modify current jobs to make them more attractive in terms of satisfaction for limited disabled older workers.

We show that the effect of retirement on various well-being measures available in the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP) are compatible with this prediction: the overall effect on life satisfaction is negligible, while satisfaction with the free time increases and satisfaction with household income decreases. The life cycle model also predicts that involuntary retirement is likely to have adverse effects because individuals would actually prefer to work in order to consume more, but are prevented from doing so. We find that indeed, involuntary retirement results in an overall negative effect that can partly be explained by a bigger drop in income satisfaction and a smaller increase in satisfaction with the free time. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

It explores the effects of some of the rather distinct perspectives on aging that have emerged, beginning with the conceptualizations, research studies, and criticisms of disengagement theory, activity theory, and role theory, leading up to continuity theory and the liberation perspective. The social theory approaches to aging and the resulting empirical studies examined here have affinities with some of the existing perspectives of counseling concepts and counseling practice. The focus is on counseling perspectives aimed at helping elderly individuals maintain a satisfactory state of psychological well-being. Particular attention is given to the reciprocal influences among social systems, individual resources, and counselor effects in helping elderly clients cope with differential demands, internal pressures, and external constraints of the social environment. An integrative framework proposing conceptual links among individual resources, social resources, and life satisfactions in old age is presented. The discussion is devoted to persuading counseling psychologists and mental health practitioners that individuals age differently and by differing processes. The issues of heterogeneity in the aging processes, the modifiability of these processes, and choices in constructing alternative futures for older persons make it possible for counseling researchers and counseling psychologists to consider aging individuals as synergistic products of ecological, biological, psychosocial, and cultural factors. © 1992, Sage Publications.

   abstract = {Germans retire early. On the one hand, early retirement is very costly and amplifies the burden which the German public pension system has to carry due to population aging. On the other hand, however, early retirement is also seen as a much appreciated social achievement which increases the well-being especially of those workers who suffer from work-related health problems. This paper investigates the relation between early retirement and well-being using the GSOEP panel data. The general picture that emerges from our analysis is that early retirement as such seems to be related to subjective well-being, in fact more so than normal retirement. Early retirement most probably is a reaction to a health shock. Individuals are less happy in the year of early retirement than in the years before and after retirement. After retirement, individuals attain their pre-retirement satisfaction levels after a relatively short while. Hence, the early retirement effect on well-being appears to be negative and short-lived rather than positive and long. Whether this is an effect of retirement itself or a psychological adaptation to an underlying shock cannot be identified in our data and remains an open research issue waiting for a more objective measurement of health.},

   abstract = {Exploratory data analysis plays a central role in applied statistics and econometrics. In the popular regression-discontinuity (RD) design, the use of graphical analysis has been strongly advocated because it provides both easy presentation and transparent validation of the design. RD plots are nowadays widely used in applications, despite its formal properties being unknown: these plots are typically presented employing ad hoc choices of tuning parameters, which makes these procedures less automatic and more subjective. In this article, we formally study the most common RD plot based on an evenly spaced binning of the data, and propose several (optimal) data-driven choices for the number of bins depending on the goal of the researcher. These RD plots are constructed either to approximate the underlying unknown regression functions without imposing smoothness in the estimator, or to approximate the underlying variability of the raw data while smoothing out the otherwise uninformative scatterplot of the data. In addition, we introduce an alternative RD plot based on quantile spaced binning, study its formal properties, and propose similar (optimal) data-driven choices for the number of bins. The main proposed data-driven selectors employ spacings estimators, which are simple and easy to implement in applications because they do not require additional choices of tuning parameters. Altogether, our results offer an array of alternative RD plots that are objective and automatic when implemented, providing a reliable benchmark for graphical analysis in RD designs. We illustrate the performance of our automatic RD plots using several empirical examples and a Monte Carlo study. All results are readily available in R and STATA using the software packages described in Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},
